# ms_17010_exploit

This is a bulk exploit tool which based on the ms 17-010. At first we tried to use the MSFRPC, but the module is not that stable. Then we directly sent the payload including a user defined reverse session to target, and open a session on the MSFRPC Server which is waiting for the target to connect. The payload is from [https://github.com/pythonone/MS17-010] (https://github.com/pythonone/MS17-010) and the reverse session is generated by msfvenom.

Usage:
1. Install msfvenom
2. Start msfrpcd service: msfrpcd -P ${password} -t 3000 -a 0.0.0.0 -S
3. Add ip address in exploit.py
4. Run exploit.py
5. Check the session on msfprc server
